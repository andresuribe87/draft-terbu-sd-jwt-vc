1.  Introduction

   TBD: why? - simplicity - JWTs are well-known, popular but doesn't
   work best with three-party-model - Also no selective disclosure,
   which impacts costs and security.

   This specification describes data formats, validation and processing
   rules for SD-JWT expresing Verifiable Credentials.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].
