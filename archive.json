It makes sense to define that since the HB JWT has some specific requirements. It also makes sense because protocol developers will need to refer to one term when they exchange presentations or verifiable presentations between issuer <-> holder <-> verifier.\r\n\r\nCan we call the Combined Format for Issuance AND Presentation the Presentation based on SD-JWTs, and if there is HB, then it is a Verifiable Presentation? \r\n\r\nThe VP based SD-JWT will have the media type `application/vp+sd-jwt` altough I'm not sure if this makes sense.

I would like to stress our brains to get a solution re-using what we already have or specialized other wel-known(s) endpoint in relation at the new roles in the wallet ecosystem\r\n\r\nIn addition to this \"intellectual\" challenge, I propose to do a PR by introducing `.well-known/openid-federation` for secure trust establishment mechanisms that cannot be repudiated over time.\r\n\r\nIn particular the role of the `trust_chain` JWS header as shown in the example below\r\n\r\n````\r\n{\r\n \"alg\": \"ES256\",\r\n \"typ\": \"vc+sd-jwt\",\r\n \"kid\": \"4-available-in-the-trust-chain\",\r\n \"trust_chain\": [\r\n   \"fIIE3jCCA8agAwIBAgICAwEwT...TWVU\",\r\n   \"aiIE+zCCBGSgAwIBAgICAQ0wD...09VZ\",\r\n   \"fyIC5zCCAlACAQEwDQYJKoZIh...9ViH\"\r\n ]\r\n}\r\n.\r\n{\r\n \"iss\": \"https://credential-issuer.example.com/\",\r\n \"iat\": 1516239022,\r\n \"exp\": 1516247022,\r\n \"type\": \"Identity\",\r\n \"_sd\": [\r\n   \"UiuRGkTW7e_5UQauGeQRQdF8u3WYevS4Fs0IuB_DgYM\",\r\n   \"tmPlXq0MID-oRXbUNHyoVZrc9Qkm8cwJTohVyOVlUgQ\",\r\n   \"vTz0JI103v4k4pKIloT83Yzi33L1SdZlWBPmsfJBefk\"\r\n ],\r\n \"_sd_alg\": \"sha-256\",\r\n \"cnf\": {\r\n   \"jwk\": {\r\n     \"kty\": \"EC\",\r\n     \"crv\": \"P-256\",\r\n     \"x\": \"TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc\",\r\n     \"y\": \"ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ\"\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nthe benefits of the federation trust chain are summarized below\r\n\r\n1. trust and protocol specific jwks are available in it\r\n2. the jwks and the metadata are verifiable having just the public key of a single trusted third party (Trust Anchor)\r\n3. the metadata of the issuer are subject of the policies of the trust chain, the trust chain may overload, add,remove, some elements from the final metadata by applying the policies contained in it. This allow us to remove the possibility that an entity may use a weak alg or defines unsupported scopes or any other property not allowed by the regulation implemented by Trust Anchor\r\n\r\nThis JWS header will be registered in the IANA registry and will be soon published in the OIDC Federation draft 29\r\n\r\nI can do the draft of the PR and ask to you a revision as usual, while regarding the first point I'd suggest more discussion on that\r\n",
