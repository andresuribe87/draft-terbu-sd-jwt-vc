It makes sense to define that since the HB JWT has some specific requirements. It also makes sense because protocol developers will need to refer to one term when they exchange presentations or verifiable presentations between issuer <-> holder <-> verifier.\r\n\r\nCan we call the Combined Format for Issuance AND Presentation the Presentation based on SD-JWTs, and if there is HB, then it is a Verifiable Presentation? \r\n\r\nThe VP based SD-JWT will have the media type `application/vp+sd-jwt` altough I'm not sure if this makes sense.
